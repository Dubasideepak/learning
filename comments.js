  comments are two types:

1.Single line comment: 

  A Single line comment is denoted by using '//'.
  Anything after '//' on line will be considered 
  a comment and won't executed as code by the JavaScript engine.

  Ex: //This is a single line comment
      let variable = 123; // This comment is at the end of a line of a code.
  
 2.Multi line comment:
   
   we can create multi line comment using '/*000000000*/'.
   This allows us to comment multiple lines.

 Ex:/*This is a multi line comment 
 let variable = 10; 
 console.log(variable);
 */
  Anything between '/*9999*/' won't be executed by the javascript.
